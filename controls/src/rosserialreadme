To run code and sync arduino commands must be run in this order
$ roscore
$ rosrun <package-name-for-test-node> tester
$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0(1) //depends on which port the arduino connects to

***prior to this***
rosserial must be installed onto the system, instructions can be found on the ros wiki for kinetic, the library must also be added 
to the arduino IDE in order for the code to upload to the arduino without compilation errors
